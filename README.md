## Introduction

The Cars Dataset Analysis project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing information about different cars. The primary objectives include cleaning the data, exploring various attributes, and extracting meaningful insights.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load the cars dataset using Pandas.
- **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values by filling them with the mean of the respective columns.
- **Data Exploration**: Inspect the dataset, including its shape and columns.
- **Value Counts**: Count the occurrences of different car makes.
- **Filtering Data**: Filter the data based on specific criteria, such as origin (Asia or Europe) and weight.
- **Removing Records**: Remove records where certain conditions are met, e.g., weight above 4000.
- **Applying Functions**: Apply functions to columns to modify data, e.g., increasing all values in the `MPG_City` column by 3.
